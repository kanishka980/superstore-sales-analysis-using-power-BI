# Superstore Sales Analysis using Power BI

Welcome to the Superstore Sales Analysis project! This repository contains the files and resources for analyzing sales data from the Superstore using Power BI. In this project, we'll delve into the Orders table to extract insights and visualize key metrics.

## Overview

The Superstore dataset is a fictional dataset often used for learning and practicing data analysis. It contains various tables related to sales, customers, products, and orders. In this analysis, we'll focus on the Orders table to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
